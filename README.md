### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is David

I am a fullstack web developer focusing on PHP and Javascript.

- My devstack consists of Nette Framework, Doctrine ORM, Symfony components, ReactJS, Typescript, jQuery, MariaDB, Elasticsearch
- More than 6 years I've been working on custom e-commerce solutions
- I spend most of my time coding in scripting languages, but I would rather prefer statically typed languages
- I like OOP, SOLID principles and clean code
- In my free time currently I am playing with modern frontend libraries such as SolidJS, Svelte, or exploring other interesting technologies
